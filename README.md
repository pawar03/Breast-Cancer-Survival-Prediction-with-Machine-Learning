# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning


Breast cancer is one of the types of cancer that starts in the breast. It occurs in women, but men can get breast cancer too. It is the second leading cause of death in women. As the use of data in healthcare is very common today, we can use machine learning to predict whether a patient will survive a deadly disease like breast cancer or not. We used a dataset of over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of breast cancer to predict whether a breast cancer patient will survive or not after the surgery.



Below is the information of all columns in the dataset:
1.	Patient_ID: ID of the patient
2.	Age: Age of the patient
3.	Gender: Gender of the patient
4.	Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: expression levels
5.	Tumor_Stage: Breast cancer stage of the patient
6.	Histology: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma
7.	ER status: Positive/Negative
8.	PR status: Positive/Negative
9.	HER2 status: Positive/Negative
10.	Surgery_type: Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other
11.	DateofSurgery: The date of Surgery
12.	DateofLast_Visit: The date of the last visit of the patient
13.	Patient_Status: Alive/Dead
